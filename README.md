## My process

I created a main container first inside which I divided into 2 containers with the help of the flex property. Then in the first container I made it for the prodsuct image and in the second container I used it for product info and stuff. I used the flex property in the info container as well in order to position the components properly and style it. At last, I used media queries to make it responsive and adjustable!


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had forgotten how to use Media Queries and this project helped me revise those core concepts!

### Continued development

I will continue building more and more websites as I still feel uncomfortable at times even though I know the concepts and I will learn more stuff in order to make the websites more complex and interesting!

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com) - Youtube is the one who has helped me from Day 1.
